## Inventory Management App
# Project Summary
This project focused on developing an Android app to simplify inventory tracking and management. The app addresses the user need for a convenient way to monitor stock levels, item details, and user accounts. It provides a user-centered interface for efficient inventory control.

# Screens and Features
The app includes several screens and features to support user needs:

# Login screen: Secure access with username/password authentication.
Main screen: Displays inventory items in a grid format, allowing users to quickly view and manage items.
Add/Edit Item screen: Enables users to add new items or edit existing ones with details like name, quantity, and description.
Item Details screen: Provides a detailed view of an item, including options to increase/decrease quantity and delete the item.
SMS notification: Sends alerts for low stock levels to help users avoid stockouts.
The UI design prioritizes user experience by providing clear navigation, intuitive controls, and a visually appealing layout. The grid format on the main screen allows for easy scanning and identification of items. The use of distinct buttons and input fields on the Add/Edit Item screen ensures a straightforward item creation/modification process.

# Coding Process
The app was coded using Java and Android Studio. A structured approach was followed, starting with planning and designing the app's architecture and database schema. The code was organized into separate classes and methods for better maintainability and readability.

Testing was an integral part of the development process. Unit tests and integration tests were used to verify the functionality of individual components and the overall app behavior. This rigorous testing process helped identify and resolve bugs early on, ensuring a robust and reliable application.

# Innovation and Challenges
One challenge was implementing the SMS notification feature while ensuring that the app continues to function correctly even if the user denies SMS permissions. This required careful handling of permission requests and alternative notification mechanisms.

# Demonstrated Skills
The project successfully demonstrated knowledge and skills in Android development, including UI design, database management, and coding best practices. The implementation of user authentication, data validation, and error handling showcased a comprehensive understanding of secure and robust app development.
